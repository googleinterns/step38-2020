# Random Restaurant Picker

Random Restaurant Picker (RRP) is a web application designed to take the stress out 
of going to restaurants and ordering takeout. Our web application will reduce the 
overwhelming number of restaurant options by considering parameters such as the userâ€™s 
location, cuisine preference, and budget to recommend a single restaurant to visit or 
order from.

The primary goal of RRP is to increase the efficiency of decision making for the 
average restaurant-goer and eliminate decision paralysis associated with selecting from 
the vast array of options available. Secondarily, this tool may encourage variety and 
exploration of restaurants as users may discover establishments they had not previously 
heard of or tried.
